Project name: Zillow-s-Home-Value-Predictio
Our project adopts the data from Zillowâ€™s Zestimate home valuation. Our goal is to build and train a model to predict the error of estimation. Through dealing with train data, we hope to find a efficient and effective model to get close value to real value.
